# Trie Prediction
By creating this program, I gained experience with an advanced tree data structure that is used to store strings, and which allows for efficient insertion and lookup: a trie! I then used this data structure to complete a text prediction program. In this program, I also learned how to test my program for memory leaks using valgrind. Completing this program taught me about tries as well as fortified my knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

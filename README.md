# Fibonacci
This program implements a Fibonacci function that avoids repetitive computation by computing the sequence linearly from the bottom up: F(0) through F(n). It also overcomes the limitations of Câ€™s 32-bit integers by storing very large integers in arrays of individual digits. By completing this program, I gained experience crafting algorithms of moderate complexity, develop a deeper understanding of integer type limitations, become acquainted with unsigned integers, and reinforced my  understanding of dynamic memory management in C.

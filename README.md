# Synchronized Buffer (Java)
In this program I implemented a bounded buffer that is used as a shared data area by producer and consumer threads. The buffer can hold only a single string value. The task is for the producer to pass a sentence one word at a time to the consumer through the buffer. The communication is successful when the consumer receives the entire sentence with no lost data and no duplicate reads. Since the sentence can be of any length, the producer will send a sentinel value to indicate the end of input; when the consumer recognizes the sentinel, it stops looking for more words to read. Both producer and consumer threads implement random waits up to two (2) seconds, so that the operation of the program will cause them to run effectively asynchronously.  This will generally result in each thread occasionally waiting for the other to read or write the next word.
